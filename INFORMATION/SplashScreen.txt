`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` is a method from the `expo-splash-screen` library that tells the splash screen to remain visible until it has been explicitly told to hide. This is useful for doing tasks that will happen behind the scenes such as making API calls, pre-loading fonts, animating the splash screen, and so on. 

`SplashScreen.hideAsync()` is another method from the same library that hides the native splash screen immediately. It's important to ensure that your app has content ready to display when you hide the splash screen, or you may see a blank screen briefly. 

In the code, `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` is called to keep the splash screen visible while loading app resources. Once the fonts are loaded, `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` is called to hide the splash screen.
